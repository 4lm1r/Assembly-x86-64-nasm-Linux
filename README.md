Some useful assembly routines for learning purposes.

I am an enthusiast in programming and Assembly, as i see, is a great
way to learn about how does the machine works. I had some ideas and 
I found some difficulties in get the needed help to write my code, so
i decided to put some progress i had made in here who knows it would
help another crazy like me? Enjoy.
